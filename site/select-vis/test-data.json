third instalment of NOW will feature a major survey of works by renowned British artist Jenny Saville, spanning some 25 years of the artist’s career across five rooms.\n\nA graduate of The Glasgow School of Art, this presentation marks the first museum exhibition of the artist’s work ever to be staged in Scotland. Featuring monumental paintings and drawings by Saville dating between 1992 and 2017, the exhibition will demonstrate the scale and ambition of the artist’s practice, and her singular and dynamic approach to composition, gesture, materials and subject matter.\n\nThis edition of NOW also features work by five further artists investigating themes of the body, performance, process and materiality: Sara Barker, Christine Borland, Robin Rhode, Markus Schinwald and Catherine Street, alongside a group display drawn from the National Galleries of Scotland collection focusing on the body and fragmentation including works by Miroslaw Balka, Alex Dordoy, Alexis Hunter and Jonathan Owen, amongst others.","description_teaser":null,"artist":null,"artist_type":null,"genre":"Art","genre_tags":null,"categories":{"strand_titles":[],"subjects":[],"keywords":[]},"discounts":{"two_for_one":null,"group":null,"friends":null,"passport":null,"schools":null},"disabled":{"audio":null,"audio_dates":null,"signed":null,"signed_dates":null,"captioning":null,"captioning_dates":null,"other_services":null,"other_services_dates":null,"other_services_information":null},"age_category":null,"website":"https://edinburghartfestival.com/whats-on/detail/now3","images":{"f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2":{"hash":"f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2","type":"thumb","orientation":"portrait","versions":{"original":{"type":"original","width":742,"height":1000,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/f9/a5/0e/f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2-original.jpg"},"square-75":{"type":"square-75","width":75,"height":75,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/f9/a5/0e/f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2-square-75.jpg"},"square-150":{"type":"square-150","width":150,"height":150,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/f9/a5/0e/f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2-square-150.jpg"},"thumb-100":{"type":"thumb-100","width":74,"height":100,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/f9/a5/0e/f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2-thumb-100.jpg"},"small-320":{"type":"small-320","width":237,"height":320,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/f9/a5/0e/f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2-small-320.jpg"},"medium-640":{"type":"medium-640","width":475,"height":640,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/f9/a5/0e/f9a50e58de547639e42a24ab7d5144bb0f1863f2-medium-640.jpg"}}}},"twitter":null,"country":null,"performers_number":null,"non_english":null,"festival":"Edinburgh

The lounge invites visitors to engage with curated playlists of archival and contemporary sound recordings. These recordings explore themes related to 'labours of love', such as artistic, affective and domestic labour.\n\nThe concept of 'labour of love' was first used by radical feminist Betsy Warrior in 1969 to ironically describe the endless chores performed by women within the home. The concept has been recently revisited to critically theorise modes of contemporary labour that exploit one's desire and drive for self-fulfilment. By blurring the boundaries between leisure and work, work becomes an endless pursuit. Individual listening stations within the gallery space will enable listeners to take different (physical) positions in which they will explore the struggle of what is all in a day’s work.","description_teaser":null,"artist":null,"artist_type":null,"genre":"Art","genre_tags":null,"categories":{"strand_titles":[],"subjects":[],"keywords":[]},"discounts":{"two_for_one":null,"group":null,"friends":null,"passport":null,"schools":null},"disabled":{"audio":null,"audio_dates":null,"signed":null,"signed_dates":null,"captioning":null,"captioning_dates":null,"other_services":null,"other_services_dates":null,"other_services_information":null},"age_category":null,"website":"https://edinburghartfestival.com/whats-on/detail/rhubaba-all-in-a-days-work","images":{"e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec":{"hash":"e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec","type":"thumb","orientation":"square","versions":{"original":{"type":"original","width":1000,"height":1000,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/e3/ed/e8/e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec-original.jpg"},"square-75":{"type":"square-75","width":75,"height":75,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/e3/ed/e8/e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec-square-75.jpg"},"square-150":{"type":"square-150","width":150,"height":150,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/e3/ed/e8/e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec-square-150.jpg"},"thumb-100":{"type":"thumb-100","width":100,"height":100,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/e3/ed/e8/e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec-thumb-100.jpg"},"small-320":{"type":"small-320","width":320,"height":320,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/e3/ed/e8/e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec-small-320.jpg"},"medium-640":{"type":"medium-640","width":640,"height":640,"mime":"image/jpeg","url":"//images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/e3/ed/e8/e3ede8dc47ed2c74d6c2ae5ec5871cec965b7eec-medium-640.jpg"}}}},"twitter":null,"country":null,"performers_number":null,"non_english":null,"festival":"Edinburgh Art Festival","url":"https://api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/events/2c77c78ad5b645d8e0d4700a1e5d81a30d28057a","updated":"2018-06-26 17:23:56","update_times":{"identity":1529316137,"title":1529316137,"description":1530030236,"venue":1529316137,"performances":1529316137,"artist":1529316137,"genre":1529316137,"discounts":1529316137,"age_category":1529316137,"fringe_first":1529316137,"other":1529316137,"disabled":1529316137,"web_links":1529316137,"images":1529316137,"status":1529316137},"latitude":55.965016,"longitude":-3.1778088,"starred":false,"pos":[689.7805473495018,285.29378872644156]},{"festival_id":"tattoo","title":"Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo","sub_title":"The Sky's the Limit","status":"active","code":"Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo","year":2018,"venue":{"name":"Edinburgh Castle Esplanade","map_ref":null,"code":"Edinburgh Castle Esplanade","description":"Make your way up Castlehill until you come to the Castle Esplanade.

This concert promises to be a very special homecoming gig for a London-born, but Edinburgh-raised artist, who is also composing new work for the International Festival’s spectacular, free, outdoor opening event. Her work has seen her create soundtracks for Prada fashion campaigns, compose music for an MRI scanner, write symphonies for nursery children and melodies for sleep-pods in Singapore. A Composer in Residence for the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Anna has also collaborated with Laura Marling and The Stranglers before working on this exhilarating new version of <em>Varmints</em> with the Southbank Sinfonia, which premiered at London’s Southbank Centre earlier this year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1092668887541156/\">Join the Facebook

He has collaborated with Tracy Thorn, Amanda Palmer and Elbow, performed in a celebration of Scott Walker at the BBC Proms, and toured the UK to enormous acclaim with the Royal Northern Sinfonia. With his rich, creamy baritone, and his savagely barbed humour, he is one of the most provocative and original songwriters in today’s pop, creating songs to make you laugh, gasp, think, perhaps even
