G. Lucas: An Individual Eye is the first major exhibition to focus on this enigmatic artist, one of the most unique Scottish painters of the 20th century. Revealing the little-known story of Lucas\u2019s life and career, it traces his development from the early watercolours of his youth to his boldly experimental oil paintings of the 1940s and 1950s. Blending Surrealist influences with his own idiosyncratic vision of the world, he cultivated an original and highly imaginative style of painting that is richly colourful and fascinatingly quirky. It also explores the artist\u2019s final, uncompromising works of the 1980s, which were produced after a break of almost thirty years. The exhibition features over sixty artworks drawn from public and private collections, including loans from the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and rare archival material from the artist\u2019s estate.","description_teaser":null,"artist":null,"artist_type":null,"genre":"Art","genre_tags":null,"categories":{"strand_titles":[],"subjects":[],"keywords":[]},"discounts":{"two_for_one":null,"group":null,"friends":null,"passport":null,"schools":null},"disabled":{"audio":null,"audio_dates":null,"signed":null,"signed_dates":null,"captioning":null,"captioning_dates":null,"other_services":null,"other_services_dates":null,"other_services_information":null},"age_category":null,"website":"https:\/\/edinburghartfestival.com\/whats-on\/detail\/edwin-lucas","images":{"709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0":{"hash":"709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0","type":"thumb","orientation":"portrait","versions":{"original":{"type":"original","width":738,"height":1000,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/70\/9d\/fc\/709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0-original.jpg"},"square-75":{"type":"square-75","width":75,"height":75,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/70\/9d\/fc\/709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0-square-75.jpg"},"square-150":{"type":"square-150","width":150,"height":150,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/70\/9d\/fc\/709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0-square-150.jpg"},"thumb-100":{"type":"thumb-100","width":74,"height":100,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/70\/9d\/fc\/709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0-thumb-100.jpg"},"small-320":{"type":"small-320","width":236,"height":320,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/70\/9d\/fc\/709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0-small-320.jpg"},"medium-640":{"type":"medium-640","width":472,"height":640,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/70\/9d\/fc\/709dfcd629cfeee986cf3fc2960404f1911b5fb0-medium-640.jpg"}}}},"twitter":null,"country":null,"performers_number":null,"non_english":null,"festival":"Edinburgh

of talks and events will provide a platform for bigger discussions on the accessibility and diversity of contemporary art in Scotland. The programme will not only celebrate the important and integral work of Travelling Gallery but will explore and test its values within today's contemporary context, advocating for its vision that we live in a Country in which everyone has the opportunity to experience and engage in the arts.\n\nTravelling Gallery\u2019s rich and socially important archive will also be shown for the first time alongside some of the original artwork from its incredible exhibitions history.

work in A Certain Light is focussed on the variability of light in the natural world, from twilight and moonlight paintings, snowy hillsides illuminated and cast with shadows to looking with the evening sun over the waters of Venice. \u00a0I have found that certain qualities of light make the painted image an epitome conveying a particular quality. The recent paintings attempt to capture the intensity of a moments vision or response and to preserve it forever, like memory. I want the work to have a timeless, resonant quality. \u00a0Victoria Crowe, March 2018\n\nVictoria Crowe studied at Kingston School of Art from 1961-65 and at the Royal College of Art, London, from 1965-68. At her postgraduate show, she was invited by Sir Robin Philipson to teach at Edinburgh College of Art. For thirty years she worked as a part-time lecturer in the School of Drawing and Painting while developing her own artistic practice. She lives and works in West Linton, Edinburgh, and Venice. Her first one-person exhibition, after leaving the Royal College of Art, was in London and she has subsequently gone on to have over fifty solo shows.\n\nVictoria Crowe\u2019s first solo exhibition at The Scottish Gallery was in 1970. This major exhibition of paintings at The Scottish Gallery,\u00a0held during the Edinburgh Festival 2018,\u00a0coincides with The Scottish National Portrait Gallery which is holding a retrospective of Victoria Crowe\u2019s portraits.\n\nThe Scottish Gallery is also exhibiting the work of Bodil Manz and Catherine Martin during Edinburgh Art Festival 2018 - You can find out more information

exclusive new exhibition, which will only be shown in Edinburgh, reveals how the taste for Rembrandt\u2019s work in Britain evolved over the past 400 years. The exhibition also reveals the profound impact of Rembrandt\u2019s art on the British imagination, by exploring the wide range of native artists whose work has been inspired by the Dutch master, over four centuries, right up to the present day.\n\nThe exhibition brings together key works by Rembrandt which remain in British collections, including Belshazzar\u2019s Feast (c.1635) from the National Gallery London, and Girl at a Window (1645) from Dulwich Picture Gallery, as well as star paintings now overseas, such as The Mill (1645\/8) from the National Gallery in Washington, which left Britain when it was sold to a US collector for the staggering sum of \u00a3100,000 in 1911.","description_teaser":null,"artist":null,"artist_type":null,"genre":"Art","genre_tags":null,"categories":{"strand_titles":[],"subjects":[],"keywords":[]},"discounts":{"two_for_one":null,"group":null,"friends":null,"passport":null,"schools":null},"disabled":{"audio":null,"audio_dates":null,"signed":null,"signed_dates":null,"captioning":null,"captioning_dates":null,"other_services":null,"other_services_dates":null,"other_services_information":null},"age_category":null,"website":"https:\/\/edinburghartfestival.com\/whats-on\/detail\/britains-discovery-of-the-master","images":{"783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a":{"hash":"783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a","type":"thumb","orientation":"landscape","versions":{"original":{"type":"original","width":1100,"height":784,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-original.jpg"},"square-75":{"type":"square-75","width":75,"height":75,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-square-75.jpg"},"square-150":{"type":"square-150","width":150,"height":150,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-square-150.jpg"},"thumb-100":{"type":"thumb-100","width":100,"height":71,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-thumb-100.jpg"},"small-320":{"type":"small-320","width":320,"height":228,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-small-320.jpg"},"medium-640":{"type":"medium-640","width":640,"height":456,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-medium-640.jpg"},"large-1024":{"type":"large-1024","width":1024,"height":730,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/78\/3e\/71\/783e71dbab0b63ddbb72ab19b2d19f16fe20f74a-large-1024.jpg"}}}},"twitter":null,"country":null,"performers_number":null,"non_english":null,"festival":"Edinburgh
